##Description of Project
======================
A web app that allows users to create cases in conjuction with another user. These initial users can also create their "side" of the case, which is the presented to all users to be voted on, commented on, and ultimately judged on. Arguments can be a combination of text, video or pictures, and cases can be given a set window to remain open.

We will use rails to create our site and manage our database, but rely heavily on JavaScript and JS templates for our look. Our user log in will be handled with the Clearance Gem. We will either use the YouTube or Vimeo API for handling our video arguments.

Finally we are using Trello to handle our user stories and will be using RSPEC and JASMINE for our test coverage.
